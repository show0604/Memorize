	<strong>Terms of Use</strong>
	<p>
		By downloading or using the app, these terms will
		automatically apply to you – you should make sure therefore
		that you read them carefully before using the app. You’re not
		allowed to copy or modify the app, any part of the app, or
		my trademarks in any way. You’re not allowed to attempt to
		extract the source code of the app, and you also shouldn’t try
		to translate the app into other languages or make derivative
		versions. The app itself, and all the trademarks, copyright,
		database rights, and other intellectual property rights related
		to it, still belong to me.
	</p>
	<p>
		I am committed to ensuring that the app is
		as useful and efficient as possible. For that reason, I
		reserve the right to make changes to the app or to charge for
		its services, at any time and for any reason. I will never
		charge you for the app or its services without making it very
		clear to you exactly what you’re paying for.
	</p>
	<p>
		The Memorize app stores and processes personal data that
		you have provided to me, to provide my
		Service. It’s your responsibility to keep your phone and
		access to the app secure. I therefore recommend that you do
		not jailbreak or root your phone, which is the process of
		removing software restrictions and limitations imposed by the
		official operating system of your device. It could make your
		phone vulnerable to malware/viruses/malicious programs,
		compromise your phone’s security features and it could mean
		that the Memorize app won’t work properly or at all.

			The app does use third-party services that declare their
			Terms of Use.

	<p>
		You should be aware that there are certain things that
		I will not take responsibility for. Certain
		functions of the app will require the app to have an active
		internet connection. The connection can be Wi-Fi or provided
		by your mobile network provider, but I cannot take responsibility
		for the app not working at full functionality
		if you don’t have access to Wi-Fi, and you don’t
		have any of your data allowance left.
	</p>
	<p></p>
	<p>
		If you’re using the app outside of an area with Wi-Fi, you
		should remember that the terms of the agreement with your
		mobile network provider will still apply. As a result, you may
		be charged by your mobile provider for the cost of data for
		the duration of the connection while accessing the app, or
		other third-party charges. In using the app, you’re accepting
		responsibility for any such charges, including roaming data
		charges if you use the app outside of your home territory
		(i.e. region or country) without turning off data roaming. If
		you are not the bill payer for the device on which you’re
		using the app, please be aware that I assume that you have
		received permission from the bill payer for using the app.
	</p>
	<p>
		Along the same lines, I cannot always take
		responsibility for the way you use the app i.e. You need to
		make sure that your device stays charged – if it runs out of
		battery and you can’t turn it on to avail the Service,
		I cannot accept responsibility.
	</p>
	<p>
		At some point, I may wish to update the app. The app is
		currently available on Android &amp; iOS – the requirements for the
		both systems(and for any additional systems I
		decide to extend the availability of the app to) may change,
		and you’ll need to download the updates if you want to keep
		using the app. I does not promise that it
		will always update the app so that it is relevant to you
		and/or works with the Android &amp; iOS version that you have
		installed on your device. However, you promise to always
		accept updates to the app when offered to you, I may
		also wish to stop providing the app, and may terminate use of
		it at any time without giving notice of termination to you.
		Unless I tell you otherwise, upon any termination, (a) the
		rights and licenses granted to you in these terms will end;
		(b) you must stop using the app, and (if needed) delete it
		from your device.
